### **The tasks you need to achieve are:**

[x] To display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items.

[x] The navigation bar should scroll with the content and then become stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.

[x] The image that is inside the article should have text wrapped around it.

[x] The `<article>` and `<aside>` elements should display as a two column layout. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window shrinks smaller the columns become narrower.

[x] The photographs should display as a two column grid with a 1 pixel gap between the images.

<br>

### **You will not need to edit the HTML in order to achieve this layout and the techniques you should use are:**

• Flexbox <br>
• Grid <br>
• Floating <br>
• Positioning

<br>

There are a few ways in which you could achieve some of these tasks, and there often isn't a single right or wrong way to do things. Try a few different approaches and see which works best. Make notes as you experiment.

<br>

### **...and just some extra stuff I did to improve the layout:**
- Added padding on the right of the article to add more space between each column
- Added a responsive breakpoint at `43.75em` = `700px`
